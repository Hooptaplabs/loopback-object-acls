# loopback-object-acls

An ACL plugin for loopback to allow dynamic acls on object level, instead of on model level.

## Why

Why needed a way to make loopback support for Acls that can change on execution time and between instances of the same Model. This will be our approach and we will work on it and consume it for our own Api.

We want to share our work to the world, get feedback and advice, and collaborate with the open-source community.


## Expected times

I personally will be working on this for some weeks while I work on other functionalities. The plan is this library will be working on one or two weeks as a MVP.
